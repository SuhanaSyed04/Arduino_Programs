These are the IoT programs carried out using sensors, various IoT devices, Arduino, Node MCU ESP8266.

Ample monitoring is necessary to ensure the proper growth and health of the plants because
they are essential to preserving the ecological cycle. With automation and internet of things
(IoT) technology, the chapter's goal is to build a smart plant monitoring system. This topic

emphasizes a number of characteristics, including intelligent decision-making based on real-
time data about soil moisture. Sensors like the soil moisture sensor, DHT11 sensor, level

sensor, etc. are utilized for this purpose. The soil moisture sensor gauges moisture content (i.e.,
water content of different plants). When the moisture level falls below the critical value, a
signal is transmitted to the Arduino board, causing the pump to start pumping water into the
plant. The pump is shut off when the moisture level reaches its absolute value. Level sensor is
the other prerequisite for this procedure. The level sensor determines the amount of water in the
tank and transmits that information to the Arduino board and to the cloud. The cloud server will
receive all of the data related to the plant monitoring.
As we can see, only a select few gadgets, such as PCs and smartphones, are internet-connected
in the modern world. Internet of Things (IoT) and the internet have completely taken over
today's world. All humans utilize the internet to fulfil basic needs. The network of actual items
is known as the Internet of Things (IOT). Simply put, it refers to the process of keeping an eye
on a physical machine or object. It can also refer to the interconnection of physical objects that
have been embedded with electronics, sensors, software, and network connectivity. The
majority of people rely on agriculture, which is the backbone of our nation.
Sensors are used to measure temperature, humidity, and light, and based on the results,
additional processing can be done. We suggest a system that will use a variety of sensors to
record all the information about the soil and temperature. Through network infrastructure, IOT
enables remote sensing or control of objects. As a result, accuracy, financial gains, and
efficiency increase while human intervention decreases. We will discuss the fundamental ideas
of IOT as well as its potential in the future in this essay. This essay examines the use of IOT in
daily life for various applications and provides a quick primer on the technology. IOT makes a
significant contribution to cutting-edge farming techniques.
Therefore, we are attempting to show IOT with an automatic watering system. The
approximate moisture level of the soil is monitored and maintained using an automatic
watering system. The control unit is implemented using an Arduino UNO as a microcontroller.
The system makes use of sensors to measure the approximate temperature, moisture content,
and humidity of the soil: temperature, moisture, and humidity. This value enables the system to
avoid over- or under-irrigation by using the proper amount of water.
